I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Texas Lutheran University, where I teach, mentor, and conduct research in algorithms, machine learning, and AI sustainability.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Arlington under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Atiqul Islam. Prior to that, I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2018 and pursued an MBA at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), University of Dhaka.

My research focuses on the theoretical, empirical, and security aspects of algorithms and machine learning, with particular emphasis on federated learning. I have developed self-regulating clients that address data-level errors and introduced new server aggregation techniques for efficient, fair, and privacy-preserving federated systems.

I am passionate about advancing sustainable and trustworthy AI while preparing the next generation of computer scientists to innovate responsibly.
